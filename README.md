# My technical blog on github

Git was not designed for blogs, it was created for coordinating code changes between multiple developers. So why write a blog on github?

The short answer is that I find the potential of github for blogs to be underestimated. And even greater so when the blog is technical in nature. 
I will express my arguments for why I think this is a good idea below.
1. **The content is alive**
Readers can come up with corrections and updates, and simply create a pull request with the suggested change. 
Think about a real world use-case: you *google* how to solve a problem in excel, and the search result returns a multitude of solutions, but most of them are outdated and only work for older versions of excel, The internet is full of *stale*, *outdated* writings. Willing readers can become valued contributors by simply submitting a Pull Request. Coupled with a clear history of all the changes
1. **Markdown is a powerful, somewhat underrated format**  
[Markdown] is:
-- lightweight
-- universal(ish)
-- readable
-- portable
1. **Git usage is becoming more broad**
Expect to see more and more stuff being shared by the means of the *git* protocol. 
While developers have been sharing code for a long time now, there are still users that have not yet embraced *git*. 
I am thinking for example at the data scientist community, who are starting to realise the benefits of versioning their python or R *scripts*, linking those scripts with working *models*, and versioning all those artefacts. 
I can also use my imagination and think of what it would mean for all of the consumer household electronics in the world to have the user-manual published on *github*. Global instant access, immediate publication, ***less paper***. It seems far-fetched but it is not an impossible future. 
Also, think about how a community of specialists in some are could come together and write an open-source book that has them all as contributors and is permanently up-to-date. 
1. **It's geeky and techy**
Yes, those who know me know that I like geeky, techy, quirky stuff. 
I tried writing my blog on medium, and linked-in, but the overall experience left something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, they are great platforms. But github is simply the place where I feel at home.
